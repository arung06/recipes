Coconut Chutney (for breakfast with Idly/Dosa)
-----------------------

* Serves - 2 to 3 persons

* Ingredients:
Grated coconut  - quarter coconut
Chilly - 1-2 (depending on spiciness required)
Tamarind - 1/2-3/4 toffee-size
Salt - to taste

* Process:
Blend grated coconut, green chillies, tamarind and salt in a mixie with a little purified water (too little water will cause insufficient blending and too much would cause spillage)

* This intermediate product is good enough to be used as chammandhi.

* To make chutney, dilute chammandhi with hot water and pour thadka (oil + mustard + curry leaves) over it.

* Curd can be used as a substitute for tamarind.
